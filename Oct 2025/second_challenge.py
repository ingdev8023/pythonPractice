# Binary to Decimal
# Given a string representing a binary number, return its decimal equivalent as a number.

# A binary number uses only the digits 0 and 1 to represent any number. To convert binary to decimal, multiply each digit by a power of 2 and add them together. Start by multiplying the rightmost digit by 2^0, the next digit to the left by 2^1, and so on. Once all digits have been multiplied by a power of 2, add the result together.

# For example, the binary number 101 equals 5 in decimal because:

# 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5


def to_decimal(binary):
    decimal = 0
    for i, number in enumerate(binary):
        decimal += int(number) * pow(2, (len(binary)-1-i))
    return decimal

to_decimal("101")
to_decimal("1010")
